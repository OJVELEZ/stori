Create a lambda image reading a container image from ECR
The lambda in execution reads a CSV file from a bucket using the pandas library.
Based on the file generated account information is sent by email using ses service
Also, the account information is stored in a dynamodb table

The code is pretty basic and a lot of improvements must be applied.
The CSV file was generated by using Faker library and a notebook which is present in this repository as well.
